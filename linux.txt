EXERCISE - LINUX
1. Write a shell script that adds an extension “.new” to all the files in the directory.

  for f in *; do 
  mv "$f" "$f.new"; done

2.Delete file which has special characters. “ -“, “—“, “*”, “$”.
  rm ">>filename.sh"
3. Write a shell script that take two input numbers from user at runtime and display arithmetic
operation on that numbers, find out max, & min number from them, find weather that numbers
negative or positive.

#!/bin/bash
num1=0
num2=0
echo -n "Enter the first number: "
read num1
echo -n "Enter the second number: "
read num2
ec	ho "first number + second number = $((num1 + num2))"
echo "first number - second number = $((num1 - num2))"
echo "first number * second number = $((num1 * num2))"
echo "first number / second number = $((num1 / num2))"
echo "first number % second number = $((num1 % num2))"

if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is maximum number"
    echo "$num2 is minimum number"
else
    echo "$num2 is maximum number"
    echo "$num1 is minimum number"
fi

if [ $num1 -lt 0 ] && [ $num2 -lt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Negative"
    echo "$num2 is Negative"
elif [ $num1 -gt 0 ] && [ $num2 -gt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Positive"
    echo "$num2 is Positive"
elif [ $num1 -lt 0 ] && [ $num2 -gt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Negative"
    echo "$num2 is Positive"
elif [ $num1 -gt 0 ] && [ $num2 -lt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Positive"
    echo "$num2 is Negative"
else
    echo "Invalid Input"
fi

4.Write a shell script that take one input number from user and print 1 to n number using three
loops (For, while, until). (N = entered number)

#!/bin/bash
## For Loop
echo "for loop::"
echo -n "Enter a number:"
read number
for((i=1;i<=number;i++));
do
   echo $i
 done

##While Loop
echo "-------"
echo "while loop::"
n=1
echo -n "Enter a number:"
read number
while  (( $n <= number ))
do
        echo "$n"
        n=$(( n+1 ))     
done

##until
echo "-------"
echo "until loop::"
i=1
echo -n "Enter a number:"
read num
until (( $i >= num+1 ));
do
      echo "$i"
      i=$(( i+1 ))
done

5.Write a shell script to display the last updated file of the newest file in a directory.

ls -lrt | tail -1
l - long listing
r - reverse list 
t - sort by modification time[newest file]

6.Write a shell script to get the total count of the word “Linux” in all the “.txt” files and also across
files present in subdirectories.

grep -c -R 'linux'
c - count
R - subdirectories

8.Display specific number of lines as follow:
1. Display first and last 10 lines of file contains
2. Display line no. 3 to 8 from file contains.
3. Display 7 lines and start from second last line in reverse manner.

2.ex +3,8p -scq file1.txt
(or) sed -n 5,8p file

3.tac file1.txt > file5.txt
sed -n '2,9p' file5.txt

10.Task to find all files from folder where file contains string 'abc'

grep -r "abc"
